I wish to convey my heartfelt gratitude to all those who were engaged in this endeavor. HG Chaitanya Charan Prabhu kept me constantly inspired to design project content, website layout and follow it up. HH Radhanath Swami's literature published by Tulsi, BBT (Bhaktivedanta Book Trust) books, www.thespiritualscientist.com by HG Chaitanya Charan Pr, HG Vraja Bihari Prabhu's "Yoga for the modern age" and HG Radheshyam Prabhu's books published by VOICE were few resources among many which played significant role in developing and enriching the content for this website. Finally, a big thanks to the IT Web Development team without whose relentless efforts, this project would not have seen the day's light.
